Bank Marketing - Decision Tree Classifier

Objective:-
The goal of this project is to build a *decision tree classifier* that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their *demographic* and *behavioral* data. We will be using the *Bank Marketing Dataset* from the *UCI Machine Learning Repository* to train and evaluate the model.

 Features:-
- *Decision Tree Classifier*: The main focus is to implement a decision tree model that can predict customer purchases based on input features.
- *Customer Demographics & Behavior*: The dataset includes demographic details such as age, job, marital status, education, and behavioral data such as previous contacts and campaign results.
- *Model Evaluation*: The performance of the decision tree classifier will be evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 Tools:-
- *Python*: The programming language used for data manipulation, machine learning model creation, and evaluation.
- *Scikit-learn*: A popular machine learning library in Python, used to build and evaluate the decision tree classifier.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: Libraries for visualizing the dataset and the decision tree.
- *Jupyter Notebook/Colab*: Interactive environments used to write, run, and document the analysis and model.

 Conclusion:-
At the end of this project, you will have built a decision tree classifier that predicts whether a customer is likely to purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. The model's performance will be assessed, and the insights derived from the analysis can help in marketing decision-making and customer targeting strategies.
